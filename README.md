# Advent-of-Code

Here are my solutions to Advent of Code, currently for the years 2023 and 2024.

I had to make my old repository private, as [Ildi](https://github.com/cseriildi) has warned me that publishing the input files is against the will of the author of these challenges. Since there is not much sense in just removing them if they are still present in the commit history, I have a brand new repo for all years now. The central makefile in 2023 folder will be still expecting these (usually named `input.txt` and placed either central or in the respective folder), so please provide your own if you want to run test cases.

My solutions for 2023 are in C, and for 2024 in C++.

I was originally ashamed of my 2023 solutions, as I did not get very far and my code was a complete mess. But looking back on it from 2024, I am more proud of it than any result I achieved a year later. I was basically only coding since a total of 3 months back then, and C was the only language I knew. Thanks to 42, I knew nothing about the libc and could only rely on functions I wrote for myself from scratch. Every challenge began like a parsing hell, took 3-4 hours of my day, and despite that, I still kept fighting. Therefore, even though the code itself is definitely not of much value and does not mirror my current understanding or use of the C language, I decided to publish it anyway.

It is also nice to see how differently I code after just a year of additional practice, and I can very much appreciate the power and all the features C++ has to offer. Honestly, I feel spoiled.
